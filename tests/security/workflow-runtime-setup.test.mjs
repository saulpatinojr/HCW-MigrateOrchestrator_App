// Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).
//
// The canonical twin of this check is the website's, scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in
// saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks: change the logic there first, then copy it here unchanged. This file is taken from
// the node:test copy in HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn (tests/security/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs), which carries
// the same logic. It was last brought up to the website's round two (HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1719). The logic between the
// lists and the workflow reader is the website's, line for line, with its single-quoted strings written in double
// quotes, and its tests are the website's, with `expect` written as `assert`. This copy keeps only its own parts: the
// lists below, the floors written in (the website reads scripts/version-floors.json), the workflow reader (the website
// parses with the `yaml` package, which is no dependency here; see `readJobs`), the floor check on every workflow (see
// the last paragraph), its own tests, the paths and these comments. It runs under `node --test` (`npm test`) rather
// than vitest. The Python copies are tests/security/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py in the three Python add-ons and in
// HCW-NetworkEyes_App, and tests/unit/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py in HCW-CloudAssessor_App and HCW-CloudCrawler_App.
//
// A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `pytest`, `uv` or `uvx` without
// actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24
// and Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices,
// because a job that names no version has nothing to read. `uv` and `uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the
// interpreter it finds, the runner's own unless one was set up; so astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only
// when it is given a `python-version` at or above the floor. `yarn` and `pnpm` are Node.js programs and count as
// Node.js; `pytest` and `pipx` are Python programs and count as Python. pipx makes each tool's virtual environment from
// the interpreter pipx itself runs on unless it is given `--python` or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`
// (https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/reference/environment-variables.html), and GitHub's Ubuntu runner images install pipx
// with the image's own python3 (actions/runner-images#14654), so setting Python up is not enough. A step that runs
// `pipx` in command position must also choose its interpreter: `--python` among that pipx command's own words (`pipx
// run --python "$PYTHON_PATH" …`, with actions/setup-python's `python-path` output), or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` set in
// front of it (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx …`) or in the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). A step that does not is reported, named; one kept that way on purpose is listed, with its
// reason, in PIPX_ALLOWED. An `export PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=…` earlier in the script is not read; use `env:` instead.
//
// What pipx is given must also be the set-up Python. The runner's own Python named by its path (`--python
// /usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/python3.12`, `/bin/python3` or the Azure CLI's `/opt/az/bin/python3`, the same as
// `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`) chooses nothing, nor does a command or process substitution this check cannot run (`"$(command
// -v python3)"`, `<(…)`) or a `$` the shell passes on as text (`'$P'`, `\$P`). A `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.python-path
// }}` value (only that output: `cache-hit` and `python-version` are not a path), given directly or through a variable
// of the step's `env:` (`--python "$PYTHON_PATH"`), counts only when `<id>` is an earlier actions/setup-python step of
// the same job that is sure to have run first, by the same rules as a set-up step with an `if:` (below); a missing id,
// a later step, a step that is not actions/setup-python or one that may be skipped chooses nothing, and so does a
// `steps` reference written another way (`steps['py'].outputs`), which names no id this check can read. A shell
// variable the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` does not set chooses nothing too, unless the script sets it itself
// before the command (`P=…;`, `for P in`, `read P`, but not `echo P=…` or `P=/x pipx …`) in the same shell or it is
// `$pythonLocation` (setup-python sets it) once an actions/setup-python step, with or without an id, is sure to have
// run first. A name set in a `-c` script, a shell fed a heredoc, a `$(…)` or a `( … )` subshell stays there, and one
// set outside reaches a child shell only when exported. A later assignment in the script wins over the `env:` value,
// and its value is read by the same rules (`P=/usr/bin/python3` chooses nothing). A bare `python3.15` still counts, and
// so does a path under `${{ env.pythonLocation }}`, by the same rule as `$pythonLocation`. Any other GitHub expression
// chooses nothing (`${{ github.workspace }}/.venv/bin/python`, `${{ inputs.python }}`, `${{ env.UNSET }}`), except `${{
// env.X }}` and `${{ matrix.X }}`, which are read as GitHub replaces them, from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`
// and from every entry of the job's matrix list, so they choose when the value they stand for does (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#109). A path is read as the shell resolves it before it is compared, so
// `/usr/bin/../bin/python3` and `/usr/./bin/python3` are the runner's own (Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#75). Settings travel the way the shell passes them: `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p bash -c
// 'pipx run x'` and `env PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p env -S 'pipx run x'` give the inner script the setting, and `sudo`
// drops every inherited setting (its default `env_reset`) unless it is given `-E` or `--preserve-env` (bare, or with a
// list that names the variable), while `sudo PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx …` sets it.
//
// A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a
// backtick, `(`, `{`, `|`, `&&`, `||` or `;`, after leading `NAME=value` assignments (the value plain text, a quoted
// string, or both run together), after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`), or after a word that runs
// the next one (`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `!`, `if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's
// options (`sudo -u nobody`, `env -i`). A wrapper's long option may be shortened as far as it stays unambiguous, as the
// commands themselves accept (`timeout --kill=5`, `nice --adj 5`); an ambiguous one is read as taking no value. A long
// or short option that takes a value takes the next word even when it starts with `-` (`timeout --kill-after -5`, `nice
// -n -5`). It counts with a path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`, `/usr/bin/env node`), because a
// path to the runner's interpreter is still the runner's, and `python3.15.2` counts like `python3`. A `$'…'` string is
// decoded as the shell decodes it (`\xHH`, `\uHHHH`, `\UHHHHHHHH`, octal `\NNN`, `\n` and the like) and read as one
// word, so `$'\x70ython3'` is `python3` while `$'node\x20x'` is the one word `node x`. A heredoc's body is read only
// for the commands the shell runs in it: `$(…)` and backticks in the body of a heredoc whose delimiter is not quoted or
// escaped (`<<EOF`, `<<-EOF`), and nothing in the body of `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"` or `<<\EOF`. It does not count in a
// comment, the rest of a heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted one runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or
// a backtick; a single-quoted one may run over several lines, as the `bash -c '…'` script of a `docker run` does) or as
// an argument (`docker run image python …`, or the first word of a line that continues the one before it). One more
// quoted string is read: the script of a shell that is itself in command position and given `-c` (`bash -c 'node x'`,
// `sh -euo pipefail -c "…"`, `sudo bash -lc '…'`, `bash -c -- '…'`). That script runs on the runner, so its commands
// count, while the same words after `docker run image` stay a container's; an unquoted script is the one word after
// `-c` (`bash -c node x.js` runs `node`, while `bash -c echo node` does not), and text written onto the `-c` is read as
// the script too (`bash -cnode x`, `bash -ec'node x'`), though bash and dash refuse that form, so reading it only errs
// towards reporting. A double-quoted `-c` script is read both ways: as the outer shell reads it (its `$(…)` and
// backticks run first) and as the inner shell does. The set-up step must come before the first such step. Limits, on
// purpose: a job that runs in a `container:` uses that image's runtime and is not checked; a script a step calls (a
// `.ps1` or `.sh` file) is not read, so a step that starts a runtime that way is listed in INDIRECT_RUNTIME. A command
// substitution inside a double-quoted string (`"$(…)"`, or a backtick pair) runs on the runner, so it is read like any
// other script, a `-c` script in it included (`echo "$(bash -c 'node x')"`); one that hands its script to a container
// (`"$(docker run img bash -c '…')"`) stays unread. A heredoc or a here-string given to a shell that reads its script
// from its input is that shell's script (`bash <<'EOF'`, `bash -s <<EOF`, `bash <<< 'node x'`), whatever the quoting of
// the delimiter, since the shell runs it; the same body given to `cat` is text.
//
// More limits, known and kept: a command named in quotes (`'node' x.js`, `"node" x.js`) is not read as that command
// (only a `$'…'` one is); `sudo python3` after a set-up step counts as covered, though sudo's `secure_path` makes it
// run the runner's own Python unless PATH is passed on (`sudo env "PATH=$PATH" …`); a step with `shell: python` (or
// `node`) runs its `run:` text with that runtime and is not read; a double-quoted `-c` script with a substitution in it
// is also read as the outer shell reads it, which can report a `pipx` that the inner shell, given the outer settings,
// runs correctly (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p bash -c "x; pipx run y $(true)"`); `unset PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` and `export`
// earlier in the script are not read; and a composite action whose set-up step takes its version from `${{ inputs.* }}`
// cannot be read, so it fails closed and needs an entry in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED.
//
// The same check is copied into the add-on and App repositories; keep the logic the same in each copy and change only
// the lists and comments.
//
// A composite action (`.github/actions/<name>/action.yml`, `runs: using: composite`) is checked like a job of its own,
// named `composite`, so its keys read `.github/actions/<name>/action.yml > composite > step name > runtime`. Its steps
// run inside the caller's job, but a caller cannot be relied on to have set the runtime up, so the action sets up what
// it runs itself. Its findings go into the same lists as a workflow's, and an exception for one goes in the same lists
// too. A job whose `steps:` is not a list, or a step that is not a mapping, stops the check with an error rather than
// being read as having no steps; this copy's line reader also refuses steps written on one line (`steps: [{…}]`, `-
// {…}`), which the website's YAML parser reads, as the Python copies' reader does. A heredoc's delimiter is its whole
// word (`<<EOF-1`, `<<E"OF"`), its body ending only at a line that is exactly that word (after leading tabs for `<<-`),
// and astral-sh/setup-uv's `python-version` is read through `${{ env.* }}` and `${{ matrix.* }}` in the forms the
// Python copies read (`3.15`, `3.15.x`, `3.15.2`; not `3.15-dev`). Every set-up step, a workflow's or a composite
// action's, must ask for the floor or newer (`floorProblems`, see the last paragraph), and one whose version cannot be
// read (`${{ inputs.* }}`) is reported unless BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED lists it. A version file is read only when it is a
// `.python-version`, `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file at a relative path inside the checkout with no `..` and no
// symbolic link on the way, and a composite action must have `runs: steps:`.
//
// A set-up step with its own `if:` covers a later step only when that step's condition makes the set-up's true: the
// same condition, one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||`, or a condition that joins one of
// those with a top-level `&&` and has no top-level `||` of its own (`a && b` runs only when `a` holds; `a && b || d`
// can run through `d` alone, so it is not split; Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393), or, when the set-up's condition
// has no top-level `||`, a condition with no top-level `||` whose `&&` terms include every one of the set-up's (`a &&
// b` covers `c && a && b`; Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#117), an `&&` term of the set-up's that joins terms
// with `||` counting as included when one of those terms is (`(a || b) && c` covers `a && c`, not `d && c`; Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#118). Otherwise the set-up could be skipped while the command still runs (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100). A set-up step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition does not test the
// job's status. Equal text means equal value only for values that stay fixed during a job (`matrix`, `github`,
// `inputs`, `needs`, `vars`, `secrets`); a term that reads anything else (`env.*`, which a step can change through
// `$GITHUB_ENV`, `steps.*`, `job`, `runner`, `hashFiles()`) is never matched by its text, so its step is reported
// (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). The one exception is `steps.<id>` of a step that comes before the
// set-up step: its outputs, outcome and conclusion are fixed once it has run (the `core-update.yml` jobs'
// `steps.refs.outputs.changed`). Prefer the fixed values in such conditions.
//
// The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a
// step's condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step
// has failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
// HCW-CloudCrawler_AddOn#73 and HCW-CloudAssessor_App#97). So the statuses a later step can run under (after success,
// after a failure, after a cancel) must all be ones its set-up step runs under too, and the rule above is applied to
// the conditions with their status-only `&&` terms taken out, but only from a condition with no top-level `||`:
// `failure() && a || b` is `(failure() && a) || b`, so taking `failure()` out would change it (Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). `||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs
// after success and failure, not after a cancel.
//
// This copy checks that each set-up step of every workflow, not only of a composite action, asks for the floor or newer
// (Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81), as the Python copies do: `python-version` or `python-version-file`,
// `node-version` or `node-version-file`, read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`), `${{
// matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix list) and the named version file. A version that names a line only
// (`26`, `26.x`, `3.15`, `3.15.x`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the
// floor's; an exact version (`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`,
// `26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming the step, rather than
// passing unchecked, unless BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED lists it with a reason. The website runs this rule on its composite
// actions only, because its scripts/version-floors.test.mjs reads its workflows' pins.
