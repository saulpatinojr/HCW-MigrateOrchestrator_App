// Every workflow job that runs Node.js or Python chooses its version (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707).
//
// The canonical twin of this check is the website's, scripts/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs in
// saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks: change the logic there first, then copy it here unchanged. This file is taken from
// the node:test copy in HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn (tests/security/workflow-runtime-setup.test.mjs), which carries
// the same logic. It was last brought up to the website's round five (HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1726, with
// HCW-NetworkEyes_App#405 for the Python copies). The logic between the lists and the workflow reader is the website's,
// line for line, with its single-quoted strings written in double quotes, and its tests are the website's, with
// `expect` written as `assert`. This copy keeps only its own parts: the lists below, the floors written in (the website
// reads scripts/version-floors.json), the workflow reader (the website parses with the `yaml` package, which is no
// dependency here; see `readJobs`), the floor check on every workflow (see the last paragraph), its own tests, the
// paths and these comments. It runs under `node --test` (`npm test`) rather than vitest. The Python copies are
// tests/security/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py in the three Python add-ons and in HCW-NetworkEyes_App, and
// tests/unit/test_workflow_runtime_setup.py in HCW-CloudAssessor_App and HCW-CloudCrawler_App.
//
// A job that runs `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `python3`, `pip`, `pipx`, `pytest`, `uv` or `uvx` without
// actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python gets whatever the runner image ships: on ubuntu-26.04 that was Node.js 24
// and Python 3.14 in November 2026, both below the program's floors (Node.js 26, Python 3.15). Nothing else notices,
// because a job that names no version has nothing to read. `uv` and `uvx` count as Python, because uv runs the
// interpreter it finds, the runner's own unless one was set up; so astral-sh/setup-uv counts as setting Python up only
// when it is given a `python-version` at or above the floor. `yarn` and `pnpm` are Node.js programs and count as
// Node.js; `pytest` and `pipx` are Python programs and count as Python. pipx makes each tool's virtual environment from
// the interpreter pipx itself runs on unless it is given `--python` or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`
// (https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/reference/environment-variables.html), and GitHub's Ubuntu runner images install pipx
// with the image's own python3 (actions/runner-images#14654), so setting Python up is not enough. A step that runs
// `pipx` in command position must also choose its interpreter: `--python` among that pipx command's own words (`pipx
// run --python "$PYTHON_PATH" …`, with actions/setup-python's `python-path` output), or `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON` set in
// front of it (`PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx …`) or in the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393). A step that does not is reported, named; one kept that way on purpose is listed, with its
// reason, in PIPX_ALLOWED. The script's own `unset`, `export` and assignments of it are read too, the last in a shell
// winning.
//
// What pipx is given must also be the set-up Python. The runner's own Python named by its path (`--python
// /usr/bin/python3`, `/usr/bin/python3.12`, `/bin/python3` or the Azure CLI's `/opt/az/bin/python3`, the same as
// `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON`) chooses nothing, nor does a command or process substitution this check cannot run (`"$(command
// -v python3)"`, `<(…)`) or a `$` the shell passes on as text (`'$P'`, `\$P`). A `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.python-path
// }}` value (only that output: `cache-hit` and `python-version` are not a path), given directly or through a variable
// of the step's `env:` (`--python "$PYTHON_PATH"`), counts only when `<id>` is an earlier actions/setup-python step of
// the same job that is sure to have run first, by the same rules as a set-up step with an `if:` (below); a missing id,
// a later step, a step that is not actions/setup-python or one that may be skipped chooses nothing, and so does a
// `steps` reference written another way (`steps['py'].outputs`), which names no id this check can read. A shell
// variable the step's, job's or workflow's `env:` does not set chooses nothing too, unless the script sets it itself
// before the command (`P=…;`, `for P in`, `read P`, but not `echo P=…` or `P=/x pipx …`) in the same shell or it is
// `$pythonLocation` (setup-python sets it) once an actions/setup-python step, with or without an id, is sure to have
// run first. A name set in a `-c` script, a shell fed a heredoc, a `$(…)` or a `( … )` subshell stays there, and one
// set outside reaches a child shell only when exported. A later assignment in the script wins over the `env:` value,
// and its value is read by the same rules (`P=/usr/bin/python3` chooses nothing). A bare `python3.15` still counts, and
// so does a path under `${{ env.pythonLocation }}`, by the same rule as `$pythonLocation`. Any other GitHub expression
// chooses nothing (`${{ github.workspace }}/.venv/bin/python`, `${{ inputs.python }}`, `${{ env.UNSET }}`), except `${{
// env.X }}` and `${{ matrix.X }}`, which are read as GitHub replaces them, from the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`
// and from every entry of the job's matrix list, so they choose when the value they stand for does (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#109). A path is read as the shell resolves it before it is compared, so
// `/usr/bin/../bin/python3` and `/usr/./bin/python3` are the runner's own (Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#75). Settings travel the way the shell passes them: `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p bash -c
// 'pipx run x'` and `env PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p env -S 'pipx run x'` give the inner script the setting, and `sudo`
// drops every inherited setting (its default `env_reset`) unless it is given `-E` or `--preserve-env` (bare, or with a
// list that names the variable), while `sudo PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=/p pipx …` sets it.
//
// A command counts when it is in command position on a line of a `run:` step: at the start, after `$(`, `<(`, a
// backtick, `(`, `{`, `|`, `&&`, `||` or `;`, after leading `NAME=value` assignments (the value plain text, a quoted
// string, or both run together), after a `case` pattern at the start of a line (`check)`) or after `case WORD in`,
// `;;`, `;&` or `;;&` on the same line, or after a word that runs
// the next one (`env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `exec`, `time`, `nice`, `!`, `if`, `then`, `do` and the like) and that word's
// options (`sudo -u nobody`, `env -i`). A wrapper's long option may be shortened as far as it stays unambiguous, as the
// commands themselves accept (`timeout --kill=5`, `nice --adj 5`); an ambiguous one is read as taking no value. A long
// or short option that takes a value takes the next word even when it starts with `-` (`timeout --kill-after -5`, `nice
// -n -5`). It counts with a path in front too (`/usr/bin/python3`, `./venv/bin/python`, `/usr/bin/env node`), because a
// path to the runner's interpreter is still the runner's, and a versioned name at or above the floor (`python3.15`, or
// the floor's own patch) counts like `python3`. A `$'…'` string is
// decoded as the shell decodes it (`\xHH`, `\uHHHH`, `\UHHHHHHHH`, octal `\NNN`, `\n` and the like) and read as one
// word, so `$'\x70ython3'` is `python3` while `$'node\x20x'` is the one word `node x`. A heredoc's body is read only
// for the commands the shell runs in it: `$(…)` and backticks in the body of a heredoc whose delimiter is not quoted or
// escaped (`<<EOF`, `<<-EOF`), and nothing in the body of `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"` or `<<\EOF`. It does not count in a
// comment, the rest of a heredoc's body, a quoted string (unless a double-quoted one runs a command with `$(`, `<(` or
// a backtick; a single-quoted one may run over several lines, as the `bash -c '…'` script of a `docker run` does) or as
// an argument (`docker run image python …`, or the first word of a line that continues the one before it). One more
// quoted string is read: the script of a shell that is itself in command position and given `-c` (`bash -c 'node x'`,
// `sh -euo pipefail -c "…"`, `sudo bash -lc '…'`, `bash -c -- '…'`). That script runs on the runner, so its commands
// count, while the same words after `docker run image` stay a container's; an unquoted script is the one word after
// `-c` (`bash -c node x.js` runs `node`, while `bash -c echo node` does not), and text written onto the `-c` is read as
// the script too (`bash -cnode x`, `bash -ec'node x'`), though bash and dash refuse that form, so reading it only errs
// towards reporting. A double-quoted `-c` script is read both ways: as the outer shell reads it (its `$(…)` and
// backticks run first) and as the inner shell does. The set-up step must come before the first such step. Limits, on
// purpose: a job that runs in a `container:` uses that image's runtime and is not checked; a script a step calls (a
// `.ps1` or `.sh` file) is not read, so a step that starts a runtime that way is listed in INDIRECT_RUNTIME. A command
// substitution inside a double-quoted string (`"$(…)"`, or a backtick pair) runs on the runner, so it is read like any
// other script, a `-c` script in it included (`echo "$(bash -c 'node x')"`); one that hands its script to a container
// (`"$(docker run img bash -c '…')"`) stays unread. A heredoc or a here-string given to a shell that reads its script
// from its input is that shell's script (`bash <<'EOF'`, `bash -s <<EOF`, `bash <<< 'node x'`), whatever the quoting of
// the delimiter, since the shell runs it; the same body given to `cat` is text.
//
// Round 3 (#1707) reads more forms the way the shell and GitHub do. A command named in quotes (`'node' x.js`, `"node"
// x.js`, `''node x`) or with a `\` in it (`\node x`) is that command, a command's name ends at an operator as well as a
// space (`node;`, `x=$(node)`), and `eval` and `builtin` run the words after them. A quoted `"NAME=…"` given to `env`
// or `sudo` is an assignment, as env and sudo read it. A runtime run through `sudo` counts as the runner's own even
// after a set-up step, because sudo looks its command up on its own fixed list of folders (`secure_path`); only `sudo
// env "PATH=$PATH" …`, which passes the PATH the shell already has, keeps the set-up one, and a step whose `shell:`
// runs through sudo runs its whole text that way. A step whose `shell:` (or `defaults.run.shell`) is a runtime
// (`python`, `node {0}`) runs it. The outer shell runs only the `$(…)` and backticks of a double-quoted string, so
// `bash -c "x; pipx run y $(true)"` runs no `pipx` outside. `unset`, `export -n` (which takes a name's export away) and
// `declare +x` are read, and so is a script line that sets PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON to a value that chooses nothing (and,
// since Copilot's third review, one that chooses, the latest change in a shell winning). sudo refuses `-i` together
// with `-E` outright, so `sudo -iE pipx` counts as having no Python chosen. A value given to pipx chooses nothing when
// it is a bare name other than the floor's own `python3.15` (PATH would find the runner's), a path under
// /usr/local/bin, a path with a `..` after a part this check cannot see, or a pattern or `~` the shell would still
// expand; a `\` in it is dropped first. `${{ env.X }}` is read as GitHub evaluates it, level by level, and `${{
// env.pythonLocation }}` stays setup-python's word, which chooses nothing when an `env:` sets `pythonLocation` itself
// or the script unsets it.
//
// Copilot's review of the round-3 ports (saulpatinojr/HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707) reads five more forms, the pre-PR
// review of those fixes three more, and Copilot's second round on the ports five more. A `PATH=` in front of a command,
// as its assignment or an argument of `env` (`PATH=/usr/bin python3`, `env PATH=/usr/bin node`), that does not start
// with the PATH the shell already has (`$PATH`, `${PATH}`) makes the command be looked up on other folders, so it
// counts as the runner's own even after a set-up step; `PATH=/x:$PATH` puts /x first and counts the same. So do `env -u
// PATH` (`--unset PATH`), `env -i` (`--ignore-environment`, a lone `-`) and `command -p`, which look the command up on
// the system's default folders; the last PATH given to env wins, and the shell fills `$PATH` in before env starts, so
// `env -i PATH=$PATH node x` keeps the set-up one. A step named in INDIRECT_RUNTIME whose `shell:` runs through sudo or
// replaces PATH counts the same, since the script it calls runs under that shell. So does a runtime named by a path in
// one of the folders of RUNNER_PYTHON_FOLDERS, which hold the runner image's Node.js too (`/usr/bin/python3`,
// `/usr/local/bin/node`), in `run:` or `shell:`, whatever came before it. That rule covers every runtime name, not only
// interpreters: `/usr/bin/pipx`, `/usr/local/bin/uv` and `/usr/local/bin/npm` are reported after a set-up step though
// `pipx`, `uv` and `npm` are not, because a program in those folders is the runner's own copy or runs on the runner's
// own interpreter, and reporting the rare one that is not errs on the safe side. A Python named by a version below the
// floor counts the same (`python3.14`); a free-threaded name (`python3.14t`, `python3.15t`) is Python too, its version
// read by its number, and a bare `python3t` counts as the runner's, since PATH holds a free-threaded Python only where
// one was asked for. A bare name given to pipx counts only when it is the floor's own `python3.15`. The commands of
// each clause of a one-line `case` are read (`case "$k" in a) node x ;; esac`), the pattern after `case WORD in`, `;;`,
// `;&` or `;;&` set apart. A `${{ matrix.X }}` in the workflow-level `env:` is never the matrix value, since GitHub
// allows only `github`, `secrets`, `inputs` and `vars` there, so it chooses nothing and sets nothing up; one in a job's
// or a step's `env:` is read as before. This copy applies that rule in `readJobs`, where it folds the workflow's `env:`
// into each job's (see `workflowLevel`). The words of a step's `shell:` in front of its shell program act on
// PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON as the words in front of a `-c` shell do (`shell: env -u PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON bash -e {0}` leaves
// pipx without the step's setting). A `defaults:` written as a one-line mapping, nested ones included (`defaults: {run:
// {shell: "python {0}"}}`), is read whole, and one YAML refuses (a plain value holding a brace, or braces and quotes
// that do not balance) stops the check.
//
// Round 4 (#1707) reads two more forms and holds Python to a higher floor. `coproc` runs the command after it (`coproc
// node x.js`, `coproc { python3 x; }`); a NAME may come first only before a compound command (`coproc NAME while node
// x; do …`), so in `coproc NAME node x` the command is NAME, as bash reads it (Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#77). A step's `shell:` is read as the runner passes it on, not as a shell would read
// it: the runner splits the program off at the first space and hands the rest to .NET, which drops double quotes and
// fills nothing in (actions/runner ScriptHandler.cs and ScriptHandlerHelpers.cs `ParseShellOptionString`,
// dotnet/runtime ProcessUtils.Unix.cs `GetNextArgument`; see `literalShell`). So `shell: sudo env PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin"
// bash -e {0}` gives env the text `$PATH:/usr/bin`, and the step's `python3` is the runner's own from /usr/bin, while a
// `$X` in a `PIPX_DEFAULT_PYTHON=` there chooses nothing (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#77). The plain `env
// PATH="$PATH" bash -e {0}` is reported too, conservatively: env cannot find bash on the PATH `$PATH` and the step
// stops (`env: 'bash': No such file or directory`, exit 127) before anything runs. Python's floor is the newest patch
// of its line (3.15.2 on 2026-11-14), by the owner's decision of 2026-11-14, so a set-up step that asks for an earlier
// patch of the line, or a command named by one (`python3.15.1` that day), is below it, while a line-only `3.15` still
// stands for the newest and passes; the tests build those cases from PYTHON_FLOOR, written in below, which moves with
// every Python patch release now. A GitHub expression in `shell:` is read as one word, as GitHub fills it in. GitHub's
// contexts reference (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/contexts) lists contexts for
// `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run` only (github, needs, strategy, matrix, env, vars, inputs); a step's `shell:` and the
// workflow-level `defaults.run` allow none, and the workflow schema (actions/languageservices, workflow-v1.0.json)
// refuses an expression there, so only a job's `defaults.run.shell` is filled in before the runner sees it. There a
// `${{ matrix.X }}` is read as each value of the job's matrix list, unless the matrix has an `include`; any other
// expression, one in a step's `shell:` or the workflow's default, or a matrix shell with an `include` is unreadable,
// and a step with an unreadable `shell:` is always reported for Node.js and Python, whatever was set up before it
// (Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#403 and HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1725; see `shellChoices`); pipx is read under each
// matrix value, and a step that runs pipx under a `shell:` this check cannot read is reported.
//
// Round 5 (HCW-HybridCloudWorks#1707) reads a step's `shell:` that is written but empty (`shell:`, `~`, `null`, a
// comment alone, `''`) as the runner does: as no shell of its own, so the step uses the job's `defaults.run.shell`,
// else the workflow's, the same as a step with no `shell:` at all (actions/runner
// src/Runner.Worker/Handlers/ScriptHandler.cs, lines 70-79 at 8cfa1049; see `givenShell`). A job's own
// `defaults.run.shell` that is null (`shell:`, `~`, a comment alone) is no shell either, so the workflow's applies, as
// the website's YAML library reads it and as this copy's reader has read it since HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#80 (see
// `defaultShell`; the Python copies read it as the job's own empty shell until round 5), while a quoted `''` still
// counts as the job's own empty shell: GitHub merges the job's defaults over the workflow's before the runner sees
// them, and that merge is not visible here.
//
// When this check changes. Owner decision 2026-11-14: round five is the last planned round. After it, this check
// changes only when (1) a real HCW workflow trips it or would get past it, or (2) a reviewer shows a way past it that a
// workflow could plausibly be written with. Any other edge case a reviewer raises is added to the known-limits list in
// this header, not to a new round.
//
// Known limits (the list later edge cases are added to): a composite action whose set-up step takes its version from
// `${{ inputs.* }}` cannot be read, so it fails closed and needs an entry in BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED; these are reported
// though they need not be, which can only add findings: a `shell: python` step's text is still read as shell too; an
// `eval` script is read as a child shell (a name set but not exported before it is not seen); a `$PATH` written inside
// double quotes or an unquoted heredoc in a nested script is read as the inner script's, so `sudo bash -c "sudo env
// PATH=$PATH node x"` is reported though the outer shell fills it in first; a folder put in front of `$PATH`, even the
// set-up one (`PATH=$pythonLocation/bin:$PATH python3 x`), on purpose; and a version named below the floor
// (`python3.14`), even where BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED lets the job set that version up. These are not reported: `eval` of a
// word joined from quoted parts (`eval no'de x'`); a `--python` path to a Python outside the folders of
// RUNNER_PYTHON_FOLDERS (`/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.12…`, `/usr/share/miniconda/bin/python3`); a relative path
// after `cd` (`cd /usr/bin && pipx run --python ./python3 x`); a value a `for` loop or `read` sets (`for P in
// /usr/bin/python3; do …`), which counts as chosen; a PATH the script sets in an earlier command (`export
// PATH=/usr/bin; python3 x`, or `PATH=/usr/bin; python3 x`); a PATH or setting written to `$GITHUB_PATH` or
// `$GITHUB_ENV` by an earlier step; the commands of a `case` clause whose pattern holds parentheses (`@(a|b))`,
// `?(a))`) or an escaped `)` (`a\))`, or whose `case` has a subject `$(…)` with spaces or `in` on the next line; and a
// set-up version `3` or `3.x` (a major line only), which reads as at the floor. `unset -n P` is read as unsetting P,
// which is what bash does unless P is a name reference. The runner fills `{0}` in with .NET's `string.Format`, where
// `{{` and `}}` stand for one brace and any other `{…}` stops the step; this check only replaces `{0}`.
//
// This copy reads YAML with its own line reader (`readJobs`, see "The workflow reader" below), which refuses the forms
// the website's `readWorkflow` and the Python copies' line reader refuse: `jobs`, a job, `steps`, a step, `strategy` or
// `matrix` written on one line, a plain or quoted value that runs over more than one line or starts on the line after
// its key, a quoted key (`'run': x`), a space before a key's colon (`run : x`), and an anchor, alias or tag (`&a`,
// `*a`, `!!str`).
//
// The same check is copied into the add-on and App repositories; keep the logic the same in each copy and change only
// the lists and comments.
//
// A composite action (`.github/actions/<name>/action.yml`, `runs: using: composite`) is checked like a job of its own,
// named `composite`, so its keys read `.github/actions/<name>/action.yml > composite > step name > runtime`. Its steps
// run inside the caller's job, but a caller cannot be relied on to have set the runtime up, so the action sets up what
// it runs itself. Its findings go into the same lists as a workflow's, and an exception for one goes in the same lists
// too. A job whose `steps:` is not a list, or a step that is not a mapping, stops the check with an error rather than
// being read as having no steps (see the paragraph on this copy's line reader above for the other forms it refuses). A
// heredoc's delimiter is its whole word (`<<EOF-1`, `<<E"OF"`), its body ending only at a line that is exactly that
// word (after leading tabs for `<<-`), and astral-sh/setup-uv's `python-version` is read through `${{ env.* }}` and
// `${{ matrix.* }}` in the forms the Python copies read (`3.15`, `3.15.x`, `3.15.2`; not `3.15-dev`). Every set-up
// step, a workflow's or a composite action's, must ask for the floor or newer (`floorProblems`, see the last
// paragraph), and one whose version cannot be read (`${{ inputs.* }}`) is reported unless BELOW_FLOOR_ALLOWED lists it.
// A version file is read only when it is a `.python-version`, `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` file at a relative path
// inside the checkout with no `..` and no symbolic link on the way, and a composite action must have `runs: steps:`.
//
// A set-up step with its own `if:` covers a later step only when that step's condition makes the set-up's true: the
// same condition, one of the terms the set-up's condition joins with a top-level `||`, or a condition that joins one of
// those with a top-level `&&` and has no top-level `||` of its own (`a && b` runs only when `a` holds; `a && b || d`
// can run through `d` alone, so it is not split; Copilot on HCW-NetworkEyes_App#393), or, when the set-up's condition
// has no top-level `||`, a condition with no top-level `||` whose `&&` terms include every one of the set-up's (`a &&
// b` covers `c && a && b`; Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#117), an `&&` term of the set-up's that joins terms
// with `||` counting as included when one of those terms is (`(a || b) && c` covers `a && c`, not `d && c`; Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_App#118). Otherwise the set-up could be skipped while the command still runs (Copilot on
// HCW-NetworkEyes_AddOn#100). A set-up step with no `if:` covers every later step whose condition does not test the
// job's status. Equal text means equal value only for values that stay fixed during a job (`matrix`, `github`,
// `inputs`, `needs`, `vars`, `secrets`); a term that reads anything else (`env.*`, which a step can change through
// `$GITHUB_ENV`, `steps.*`, `job`, `runner`, `hashFiles()`) is never matched by its text, so its step is reported
// (Copilot on HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). The one exception is `steps.<id>` of a step that comes before the
// set-up step: its outputs, outcome and conclusion are fixed once it has run (the `core-update.yml` jobs'
// `steps.refs.outputs.changed`). Prefer the fixed values in such conditions.
//
// The job's status is compared on its own. Without `always()`, `failure()`, `cancelled()` or `success()` in it, a
// step's condition includes an unwritten `success()`, so a set-up step with no `if:` is skipped once an earlier step
// has failed, while a later `if: always()`, `failure()` or `!cancelled()` step still runs (Copilot on
// HCW-CloudCrawler_AddOn#73 and HCW-CloudAssessor_App#97). So the statuses a later step can run under (after success,
// after a failure, after a cancel) must all be ones its set-up step runs under too, and the rule above is applied to
// the conditions with their status-only `&&` terms taken out, but only from a condition with no top-level `||`:
// `failure() && a || b` is `(failure() && a) || b`, so taking `failure()` out would change it (Copilot on
// HCW-MigrateOrchestrator_AddOn#74). `||`, `&&`, `!` and parentheses are followed: `always() && !cancelled()` runs
// after success and failure, not after a cancel.
//
// This copy checks that each set-up step of every workflow, not only of a composite action, asks for the floor or newer
// (Copilot on HCW-CloudCrawler_App#81), as the Python copies do: `python-version` or `python-version-file`,
// `node-version` or `node-version-file`, read through `${{ env.X }}` (the step's, job's or workflow's `env:`), `${{
// matrix.X }}` (every entry of the job's matrix list) and the named version file. A version that names a line only
// (`26`, `26.x`, `3.15`, `3.15.x`) stands for that line's newest release, so it passes when the line is at or above the
// floor's; an exact version (`26.10.0`) must be at or above the floor itself; anything else (`26.11.0-rc.1`,
// `26.11.0.0`, `lts/*`) cannot be compared. A value this test cannot work out fails it, naming the step, rather than
